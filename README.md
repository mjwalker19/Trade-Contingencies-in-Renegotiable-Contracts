# Trade-Contingencies-in-Renegotiable-Contracts
This repository contains video instructions and code for my "Trade Contingencies in Procurement Interactions" working paper.

**Abstract:** It is difficult to write a perfect contract. Contracts are often renegotiable and parties to a contract may understand their obligations differently. When these differences are important, disputes over buyer and seller non-performance arise. This paper addresses the problem of seller non-performance in procurement, by developing a flexible price contract structure that contains an arbitration clause. We embed this structure into a procurement interaction, where the contract price bounds are determined under competitive conditions. We test the predictions of the model in a laboratory experiment. Our theoretical results suggest that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of price flexibility and the probability of arbitration, for which trade is efficient. This contract is robust in that it relies only on the regard of each party to their own interest. We find support for the model in our experimental data. Yet the shadow of an arbitrator crowds out buyer reciprocity, and so a contingent contract does not increase trade efficiency relative to a flexible-price contract that contains non-binding incentives. Our findings have several managerial implications for the establishment of trust and procurement efficiencies driven by competition.
