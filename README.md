# Trade-Contingencies-in-Renegotiable-Contracts
This repository contains video instructions and code, for replication purposes, of my "Trade Contingencies in Renegotiable Contracts" working paper.

> **Abstract:** I analyse the effect of an arbitrator on the outcomes of renegotiable procurement contracts allocated at a price-based auction. If the seller has no contractual incentive to deliver high quality, trade is inefficient. It is shown that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of price flexibility and the probability of arbitration, for which an efficient trade outcome can be achieved in equilibrium. This contract exists independently of the arbitratorâ€™s preferences. The result holds so long as the cost of arbitration is low enough and the availability of an arbitrator uncertain. Guaranteeing the availability of an arbitrator can be welfare-decreasing. I test the predictions of the model in a laboratory experiment. Consistent with the theory, bidding is more competitive and high quality is incentive compatible in the presence of an arbitrator. Yet a contingent contract cannot increase trade efficiency relative to a voluntary incentive arrangement. The arbitrator becomes a substitute for buyer reciprocity. There is evidence that a significant fraction of buyers exhibit reference-dependent fairness preferences. The findings have implications for the establishment of contractual trust and procurement efficiencies driven by competition.
