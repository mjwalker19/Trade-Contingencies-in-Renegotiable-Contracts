# Trade-Contingencies-in-Renegotiable-Contracts
This repository contains video instructions and code for my "Trade Contingencies in Competitive Procurement Interactions" working paper.

**Abstract:** I analyse the effects of a contingent contract, implemented via an arbitration mechanism, in competitive procurement interactions. With no contingency in the contract, a seller moral hazard problem arises, and trade is inefficient. It is shown that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of price flexibility and the probability of arbitration, for which trade is efficient in the unique equilibrium outcome. This outcome benefits the buyer, who holds the balance of market power, suggesting that commonly held beliefs about the fairness benefits of arbitration may not apply in competitive environments. I test the main predictions of the model in a laboratory experiment. Consistent with the theory, bidding is more aggressive and high quality is incentive compatible with a contingent contract. Yet the arbitrator crowds out buyer reciprocity and the contingent contract yields no significant increase in trade efficiency relative to a non-contingent contract. A sizeable fraction of buyers exhibit reference-dependent preferences. The findings have implications for the establishment of trust and procurement efficiencies driven by competition.
