# Trade-Contingencies-in-Renegotiable-Contracts
This repository contains video instructions and code, for replication purposes, of my "Trade Contingencies in Renegotiable Contracts" working paper.

> **Abstract:** I analyse the effect of an arbitrator on the outcomes of renegotiable contracts allocated at a price-based auction. If the seller has no contractual incentive to deliver high quality, trade is inefficient. It is shown that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of contractual flexibility and the probability of arbitration, for which an efficient trade outcome can be implemented in equilibrium. This contract exists independently of the arbitratorâ€™s preferences. The theoretical result holds so long as the cost of arbitration is low enough and the availability of an arbitrator is uncertain. I test the predictive power of the model in a controlled laboratory experiment with human subjects. Consistent with the theory, high quality is observed to be incentive compatible in the presence of an arbitrator. Yet a contingent contract cannot increase trade efficiency relative to a voluntary incentive arrangement. The arbitrator becomes a partial substitute for buyer reciprocity. There is evidence to suggest a significant fraction of buyers exhibit reference-dependent fairness preferences. The findings have implications for the establishment of welfare-enhancing trust between trade parties and efficiencies driven by competition.
